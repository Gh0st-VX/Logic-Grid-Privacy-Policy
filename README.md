Finally, here is some legal information about your rights

Where the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) applies to the processing of your personal data, especially when you access the website from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have the following rights, subject to some limitations:

    The right to access your personal data;
    The right to rectify the personal data we hold about you;
    The right to erase your personal data;
    The right to restrict our use of your personal data;
    The right to object to our use of your personal data;
    The right to receive your personal data in a usable electronic format and transmit it to a third party (also known as the right of data portability); and
    The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so by mailing connor.morrell.cross@gmail.com
Please understand, however, the rights enumerated above are not absolute in all cases.
Where the GDPR applies, you also have the right to withdraw any consent you have given to uses of your personal data. If you wish to withdraw consent that you have previously provided to me, you may do so by mailing connor.morrell.cross@gmail.com
However, the withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
I will do my best to provide these rights to people outside the EEA

I do not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 13, nor do I knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13. If it found that data has been obtained from an under 13-year old, that data will be removed. 
EU residents under the age of 16 should not submit their personal data (e-mail), and I will delete any such data if I become aware of it.
